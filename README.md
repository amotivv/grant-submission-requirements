1. **Problem Statement (75 words):** In this section, the applicants are asked to describe the issue they're addressing without mentioning their product or solution. The response should be in third person, using the company's short name. References are key in the format: "(Smith, 2018)" or "(Amazon, 2020)". The statement should describe a substantial, quantifiable problem and its impact.

2. **Technical Challenge (60 words):** This section should define the main technical hurdle or reason why the problem hasn't yet been solved, demonstrating that the project proposes a novel innovation. The answer should focus on technical limitations, and it should explain why the problem hasn't yet been solved if there is no technical challenge.

3. **Proposed Solution (50 words):** This should be a high-level summary of the end product to be developed with the knowledge or technology obtained during the project. It should mention what the solution is (e.g., a platform, an app) and its intended benefit. The answer should be in future tense, as the proposal should be in the ideation phase.

4. **Technical Elaboration (150 words):** One of the most important sections, this answer should explain in technical detail exactly how the proposed innovation will work. It's not about explaining what the innovation does, but rather how it will technically operate, walking through it step-by-step.

5. **Present State of the Art and Solution Superiority (90 words):** This needs to describe the current state of the art related to existing technologies/methods and explain their limitations. It should also explain how their solution will be superior and how the technology is more innovative.

6. **Innovation's Industry Impact (35 words):** This answer should consider how the insights gained throughout the proposed project could benefit the wider industry or advance knowledge in your field.
